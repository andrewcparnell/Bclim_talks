## Outline:
Three main points above

## Grand research challenge:
A spatio-temporal palaeoclimate map of the world incorporating uncertainty

## General approach:
To model the data generating process and constrain this with ‘reasonable’ climate change
Perhaps use a flow chart here

## Illustrations:
1) Bclim - Monticchio
2) RSL - North Carolina

## Illustration 1:
Bclim - talk about technical details of the forward modelling approach

Bclim - talk about technical details of the climate constraints

RSL - talk about technical details of the IGP approach

## Other people’s work 
Some other people who have done similar things: Tingley, Tolwinski-Ward

## Bayes
Look at these in terms of likelihoods and prior, and inversion

## Computational issues
Talk about MCMC and computation

## How far away am I from the grand challenge?
- Space-time priors vs climate models
- Better forward models
- multiple proxies

## Model checking
- How can you check a model of the past?
- Posterior predictive/cross validation

## Other issues
- time uncertainty
- proxies with differing climate sensitivities
- Being careful with choice of aspects of climate

## How can you get involved?
- Work together! We need climate modellers, proxy experts and statisticians
- If you are a proxy expert, think about the data generating process and how it can be broken down
- If you are a climate modeller, how can your model be simplified to provide quick and easy constraints on a climate history?
- If you are a statistician, how can you start to stitch these data sets together to make inferences in a reasonable computational time frame?

## Conclusions
- Three points from before
